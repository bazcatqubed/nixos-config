= Alice, test user
:toc:

This is a user primarily included in test systems.
Despite this being only a test user, it follows a certain design:

* This user should include a nice-looking terminal prompt configuration for screenshotting test systems.
* A nifty editor configuration as a closer representative of the usual systems I manage here.
* This user should be portable enough for deployment in actual systems.
