= ni, my (only) workstation
:toc:

My laptop.
I was about to have two computers but my desktop is broken ever since.
Whoops!

I try to be minimal with my dependencies unlike last time.
`direnv`, `lorri`, and Flatpak are mostly enough for desktop needs.
(Which is Fedora Silverblue is good at! :))

I know partitioning is not your favorite part so here's one way to prepare the laptop with this config.

[source, shell]
----
# Preparing the partitions.
parted /dev/sda -- mklabel gpt
parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary 512MiB -4GB
parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary linux-swap -4GB 100%
parted /dev/sda -- mkpart ESP fat32 1MiB 512MiB
parted /dev/sda -- set 3 esp on

# Setting up the filesystems.
mkfs.ext4 -L nixos /dev/sda1
mkswap -L swap /dev/sda2
mkfs.fat -F 32 -n boot /dev/sda3

# Mount the partitions before installation.
mount /dev/disk/by-label/nixos /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/boot
mount /dev/disk/by-label/boot /mnt/boot
swapon /dev/disk/by-label/swap
