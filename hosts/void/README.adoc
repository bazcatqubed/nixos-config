= void, the host that shouldn't exist
:toc:

It's a host that it's only used for testing and workflow-building.
That's it.

It shouldn't exist in this Git repo.
You shouldn't see this nor use this as your daily host.
If it does, we wouldn't talk about this footnote:[Maybe I've gone lazy and not having to `git add` every time to test something but still... wouldn't talk about this.].
