                    A single-user instance for the purpose of showing my personal projects without a bunch of scattered projects I forgot to remove in my other code repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
                    Includes my personal projects (of course) and a bunch of mirrored repositories I'm mainly interested in archiving.

                    Though this is a single-user instance, I'm also interested in collaboration in this instance.
                    Feel free to send some patches in email at <code>$FOODOGSQUARED_GITEA_USER@$FOODOGSQUARED_DOMAIN</code> and I'll consider it to be merged.
                    If the time comes, the need for email patches is reduced once <a href="https://forgefed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ForgeFed protocol</a> has been implemented.
                    Once that happens, that would be the preferred way of collaborating.
