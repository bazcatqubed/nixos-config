= Zilch, the main workstation

This is Zilch, the main machine (and only desktop as of 2020-08-16).
As such, it contains muh games and other stuff I attempt to bring over to Linux such as my music production workflow (I'm also learning how to compose music __properly__) and computer-aided designing with computers.

One of the main points to keep in mind is the `dots` alias attached to the main user.
It provides a convenient way to upgrade the whole system in one fell swoop.
You can use https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-profiles[user profiles] and run local upgrades (e.g., `nix-env -i all`, `home-manager switch upgrade`) for your other accounts.

Just to make this note seem more important, I'll just list the games I'm currently into:
