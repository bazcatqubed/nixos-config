= Zilch, the main workstation

This is Zilch, the main machine (and only desktop as of 2020-08-16).
As such, it contains muh games and other stuff I attempt to bring over to Linux such as my music production workflow (I'm also learning how to compose music __properly__) and computer-aided designing with computers.

Just to make this note seem more important, I'll just list the games I'm currently into:

- https://play0ad.com/[0 A.D.]
- https://wesnoth.org/[Battle for Wesnoth]
- http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/[Dwarf Fortress]
- https://endless-sky.github.io/[Endless Sky]
- https://www.minetest.net/[Minetest]
- https://openmw.org/en/[OpenMW]
- https://veloren.net/[Veloren]
