= Host-specific configuration
:toc:

These are configurations that are specific to a machine (e.g., desktop, servers, VM, containers).
Ideally, it should be made minimal as much as possible considering you also have to manage your users.

For managing users, there are multiple ways to manage them with this config:

* The usual `users.users.${user}` from system configuration (see `man configuration.nix.5`).

* Modularize them (see link:../users/README.adoc[User-specific configuration] for more information).
If you have user-specific configs in set, you have to manage them with link:../modules/users.nix[`modules.users.users`] which is my implementation of managing users (e.g., `modules.users.users = [ "foo-dogsquared" ]`).
