= Tasks
:toc:

These are tasks typically specific for a certain setup.
So if you're not me, don't use it.
Why?

* Most of the ones in the worktree are not complete and only there to make initial setups easier.
Though, with link:../../../secrets/[secret management], it is actually easy.
I just haven't committed them yet due to various reasons. ;p

* They are specifically catered to the owner of this repo.

Feel free to steal it, though. :)
