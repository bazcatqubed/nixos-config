It's the ultimate theme for the desktop!
The workflow of GNOME with the flexibility of Plasma: KNOME.

But seriously, this is my attempt at replicating the workflow of GNOME as closely as possible all the while using the features found in KDE Plasma.
Especially with the link:https://pointieststick.com/2021/11/19/this-week-in-kde-most-of-gnome-shell-in-the-overview-effect/[recent release of the overview effect] taken from GNOME, it's becoming more possible.
Why?
Why not.
Just want to see what's on the other side of things.

For future references, here's what I want to get from this customization:

* Get to GNOME aesthestics as close as possible.
* Make good use of the launcher (i.e., Krunner) as a replacement for GNOME search providers.
* Integrate most of the settings in the theme module as much as possible without using third-party plugins and scripts.
