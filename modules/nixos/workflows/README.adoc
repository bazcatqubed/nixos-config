= Workflows
:toc:

These are where my workflows are defined and configured.
Basically, workflows are mainly graphical sessions concerned with aesthetics and impose a structured way of using things, this may include Unix rices and good 'ol reliable desktop configurations like my link:./a-happy-gnome[GNOME config].
This is where modules will define how you're going to interact with the computer whether you should use something ranging from a full-fledged desktop environment with bells and whistles to a minimalist desktop environment only composing of a window manager, a terminal, and a bar.

The following list is the summary which can also serve as a guideline to developing a workflow module.

* Due to the bigger scope and importance of this module, there is a limit where you can only enable one theme at a time.
You can disable this with `config.workflows.disableLimit` set to `true`.

* Custom themes should be defined in `config.workflows.workflows` attribute (e.g., `options.workflows.workflows.a-happy-gnome`, `options.workflows.workflows.simple-way`).
This makes up for a namespace entirely dedicated for setting themes.

* Using link:../profiles[profiles] are heavily discouraged and it is better assumed to design and create workflows as if profiles are not imported.
This is because profiles are not exported in the flake output.
If it's something you have to use (e.g., setting up i18n configuration), you have to conditionally set a profile as seen from link:../profiles/README.adoc[../profiles/README.adoc].
