      Setting some recommendation and requirements for systemd-managed
      gnome-session components. Note there are the missing directives that
      COULD include some sane defaults here.

      * The `Unit.OnFailure=` and `Unit.OnFailureJobMode=` directives. Since
      different components don't have the same priority and don't handle
      failures the same way, we didn't set it here. This is on the user to
      know how different desktop components interact with each other
      especially if one of them failed.

      * Even if we have a way to limit starting desktop components with
      `systemd-xdg-autostart-condition`, using `Service.ExecCondition=`
      would severely limit possible reuse of desktop components with other
      NixOS-module-generated gnome-session sessions so we're not bothering
      with those.

      TODO: Is `Type=notify` a good default?
      * `Service.Type=` is obviously not included since not all desktop
      components are the same either. Some of them could a D-Bus service,
      some of them are oneshots, etc. Not to mention, this is already implied
      to be `Type=simple` by systemd anyways.

      TODO: A good balance for this value, probably?
      * `Service.OOMScoreAdjust=` have different values for different
      components so it isn't included.

      * Most sandboxing options. Aside from the fact we're dealing with a
      systemd user unit, much of them are unnecessary and rarely needed (if
      ever like `Service.PrivateTmp=`?) so we didn't set such defaults here.

      As you can tell, this module does not provide a framework for the user
      to easily compose their own desktop environment. THIS MODULE ALREADY
      DOES A LOT, ALRIGHT! CUT ME SOME SLACK!

      Take note that the default service configuration is leaning on the
      desktop component being a simple type of service like how most NixOS
      service modules are deployed.
