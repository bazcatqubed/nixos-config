= Fair and square

A theme featuring fairly simple graphics with not much bells and whistles.
Thus, it focuses on snapiness and efficient use of keyboard shortcuts.
Intended to be used for potatoes (READ: cheap low-end computers) like mine.

This theme is mainly composed of the following components:

- bspwm as the window manager
- polybar for the bars
- rofi for the application laucher and the generic interface
- dunst (and libnotify) for desktop notifications
- Arc is the chosen GTK theme

Other miscellaneous stuff:

- sxhkd (since you're using bspwm, anyways)
- feh (for setting the background)
