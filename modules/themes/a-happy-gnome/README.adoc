= A happy GNOME
:toc:

Yes, it's a theme that configures GNOME.
I mostly want a usable GNOME environment out-of-the-box (with my modifications and whatnot).

Among others, it has `chrome-gnome-shell` out of convenience provided you have a browser installed.
A couple of extensions such as ArcMenu and what not.
