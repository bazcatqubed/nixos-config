Custom utility to fetch website icons.

[#quickstart]
== Quickstart

[source, shell]
----
extract-website-icon -url $URL
----

This will create a file named `icon` in the current directory.
The current process basically goes like the following:

* It will get the icons through parsing the HTML document of the given URL.
Specifically, through its declared icons and the webmanifest.
If any of the icons exist, it will get it from there.

* If fetching icon from the previous source failed, it will fall back with Google icons API service.

* If there's no such icon returned from the icon service, it will generate a generic one instead.

[#building-from-source]
== Building from source

You simply need Go toolchain, pkg-config, and fontconfig (required for the icon generation step since it will get font files through it).
And simply run the following:

[source, shell]
----
go build .
