        A set of [Tinted Theming](https://github.com/tinted-theming) schemes.
        You can set the palette to whatever criteria you deem suitable but this
        module closely follows the main standards with this theming ecosystem
        (specifically Base16 and Base24).

        The most common palette scheme is Base16 where the colors are set from
        `base00` to `base0F`. Some themes could have 24-colors variant or have
        additional meaningful names (e.g., `foreground`, `background`).
