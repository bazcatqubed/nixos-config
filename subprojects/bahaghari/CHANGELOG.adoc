= Changelog
:toc:

All changes in Bahaghari will be documented here for their users to see.
The structure is loosely based on https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/[Keep a changelog format] except we separate the sections by the module and the library set instead.
This is structured like this so it is easier to skim things.
