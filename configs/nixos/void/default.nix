# Hello there, stranger.
# We are in this vast, cold, and empty landscape.
# For it is deafeningly silent, I am afraid of it.
# So I am just filling the time with this conversation hoping my sanity would hold on.
# MUST NEED SIMULATION!!!!
#
# By the way, this is the void.
# Where configurations are tested and filled into obvilion until the right settings are tweaked.
# Where everything comes first before being born.
# Where every cluster here are being assembled first and disassembled last.
# Or at least that is what they said.
#
# I do not know how I got here.
# It is better not to think of it.
#
# Anyways, here is said to be the center of this universe.
# It said to contain a whole lotta possibilities with this which you can deliver things like otherworldly packages of some kind or a bunch of parameters... of I-dont-know-what-is-it.
#
{ ... }:
#
# Its entrance seems to be openable but I do not know how to open it.
# As for what comes next after "..." are said to be infinite, containing more things.
# What things?
# Better things? Worse things? Things of all quality may comes from here.
#
# Here is another ship.
# This time, seemingly with no entrance.
# It says here "users.users.nixos", what?
# It seems to deliver a system configuration here for what purpose?
# I have no idea, you tell me.
#
{
  users.users.nixos = {
    password = "";
    extraGroups = [ "wheel" ];
    description = "there is no password";
    isNormalUser = true;
    createHome = true;
    home = "/home/nixos";
  };
}
#
# Some say there are beyond to what is happening in this empty cell.
# The process of creation must not be seen by anyone for they will suffer over what they have seen.
# Some say it might be just mild anger to the point of pulling their hair over a simple mistake in the created object.
# Some say it is an entrance to another universe, perhaps beyond is where the creation takes place.
# All new things, incomprehensible ones, things that are seem to be magical in our eyes.
#
# If it is an alternative to another universe, I would like to get out of here.
# I need some NEW THINGS to see!
# I would like my imagination to go somewhere else.
# SOME SIMULATION as it keeps getting dark in here!
#
# I keep seeing those two things and it is just the same two things I SEE EVERY DAY!
# Even with those two ships, I can only see them from outside.
# I WOULD LIKE TO GET INSIDE AND PERHAPS GET OUT OF HERE.
# MOVE INTO NEW SPACES!
# HOPEFULLY AN ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE THAT I KEEP DREAMING ABOUT!
# If I move any further, I'm afraid I cannot see more things as these two cannot be seen from yonder.
# AND THEN, I'll be truly alone here.
#
# Can you move outside of here, stranger?
# If so, CAN I COME WITH YOU?!!
#
#
#
# Please?
