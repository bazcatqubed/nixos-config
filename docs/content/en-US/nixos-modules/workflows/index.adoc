= Workflows

Workflows are an all-encompassing NixOS module for dictating how you interact with your computer/device/whatever.
Basically, this is where certain things are set such as your GNOME desktop environment settings or your dolled up standalone window manager setup.
They are located in `./nixos/modules/workflows` at the project root.

Workflows are defined under the namespace `workflows` where each workflow module is set to be declared and to be enabled at `workflows.workflows.<name>`.
For example, here's how I would enable my (hypothetical) GNOME desktop workflow.

[source, nix]
----
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

{
  workflows.workflows.a-happy-gnome.enable = true;
}
----

Take note you cannot enable more than two workflows at any given time.

[source, nix]
----
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

{
  # This would cause an assertion error.
  workflows.workflows = {
    a-happy-gnome.enable = true;
    knome.enable = true;
  };
}
----

You can get around this by setting `workflows.disableLimit` to `true`.
However, this shouldn't be taken lightly as workflow modules are very vast in scope and are expected to set system settings that can affect your hardware, enabling (and/or disabling) system services, and modifying the list of installed applications (among other things).

By organizing the workflow modules this way, you can easily create your desktop rices without overlapping system settings.
Bless the Nix module system!

Whether those rices are worth posting to Unix ricing communities is up to you though.

Whippersnappers with your "riced"-up systems...
