= Channels support

While this primarily uses flakes as its main form of distribution, this project does keep some use cases for traditional channels.
It's not guaranteed to be good as xref:../../05-using-parts-of-my-configuration/index.adoc#using-my-config-with-flakes[Using my config with flakes] but it's an option.
Anyhow, there is a section for using my configuration with channels as shown in xref:../../05-using-parts-of-my-configuration/index.adoc#using-my-config-with-channels[Using my config with channels].

The entry point is found at github:{github-repo}[`./default.nix`, path=./default.nix, rev=master].

.`default.nix`
[source, nix]

However, you have to keep some limitations and guidelines in mind.

* It exports an attribute based from the github:nix-community/NUR/[NUR template].

Several exports includes...

* My custom library at `lib`.
* Custom NixOS modules at `modules`.
* Custom home-manager modules at `hmModules`.
* An overlay of my custom packages at `overlays.foo-dogsquared-pkgs`.
* My packages as the rest of the top-level attributes from the attrset.
--

* Keep in mind it doesn't export the NixOS hosts and home-manager user configurations.
It would be pointless as it is duplicating effort plus **I really like managing my NixOS config more with the flakes way** compared to setting up channels.
It has a lot of advantages such as the ease of provisioning and updating your setups along with its dependencies, enforcing certain values in a certain attribute that can be seen in the revised Nix CLI, and nicer interface overall.
While possible with channels, this is just better experience overall and I have no interest in maintaining setups in both ways.
