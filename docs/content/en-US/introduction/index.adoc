Hey there, fellow traveler!
You've fell into the rabbit hole we call Nix where it leads to other rabbit holes such as functional package management, reproducibility, declarative systems, and immutable operating systems.

Legends say the rabbit hole runs so deep you'll eventually spend hours to create a dedicated website only for your NixOS configuration.
However, I haven't seen this for myself nor I see much examples of it.
But it is just mere legend anyways for a radically different package management, operating system, and deployment method, so who cares really.

Anyways...
What you're seeing right now is the documentation for my NixOS configuration as a link:https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-25-flakes/[Nix flake].
It eventually evolves as a massive blob of abomination that will surely get simpler as time go by.

Hugo?
With Asciidoctor?
With a customized version of github:foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-more-contentful[your own theme]?
Of all options!?!

Why not use something like github:rust-lang/mdBook[mdBook]?
Or link:https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/[mkdocs-material] that makes things eas-

You know what, I'm not going to continue with this.
I think I know why.
