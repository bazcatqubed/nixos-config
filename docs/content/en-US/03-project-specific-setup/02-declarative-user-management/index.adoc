= Declarative user management

Similarly to xref:../01-declarative-host-management/index.adoc[Declarative host management], this project also provides a way to declare home-manager users.
The `users.toml` sits in the project root expecting certain data.
Similar to `images.toml`, it expects a table of users with each representing one of the users from github:{github-repo}[`./users/home-manager/`, path=./users/home-manager/, rev=master].
These are then included as part of `homeConfigurations` for easier installation with the standalone home-manager tool.
Of which they are then included as part of deploy nodes for deploy-rs (also for easier deployment).

Here's an example user with complete schema.

- `systems` contains a list of platforms of the home-manager user.
This is mainly used to indicate the platform used for the nixpkgs repository.

- `nixpkgs-channel` indicates the branch of the nixpkgs to be used.
By default, this uses the `nixpkgs` which follows the `nixos-unstable` branch.

- `home-manager-channel` contains the home-manager channel to be used.
The value should be one of the home-manager channel that is imported into this flake.
By default, it sets the home-manager channel at `home-manager` which is pointed at the unstable channel.

- `home-directory` is the associated home directory of the home-manager.
It is set for `config.home.directory` at the home-manager configuration.
By default, it will be set at `/home/$USERNAME`.

- `username` is the username of the home-manager user to be used for `config.home.username` at the home-manager configuration.
If unset, it will use the table key.
In the above example, the unset value would be `foo-dogsquared`.

- `deploy` is pretty similar to the previous configuration setting that it sets certain options for deploy-rs.
