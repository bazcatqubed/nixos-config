Hey there!
This is my NixOS configuration abomination documentation "book" called "foodogsquared's NixOS config" book or "f(a)Nc(y)" config book for short.

.Here's a Nix snowflake logo for some reason

Why don't you start skimming the "book" by taking a glance at the table of contents over there.

I suppose you can view an entire page of it at link:./menu[`./menu`].

You didn't bother to improve the way how the menu rendered though unlike in mdBook or something similar.

Yeah, so?
It just happen to double as a neat standalone way to view the table of contents.
It's a feature, not a bug.
