= foo-dogsquared's NixOS config
:toc:

This is my NixOS config as a link:https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-25-flakes/[Nix flake].

I finally have some time trying to grok flakes and redo my NixOS config from scratch after leaving NixOs (because I have work and have to quickly set things up without me trying to debug how NixOS works).
Here is the result.




== Installation

This primarily uses Nix flakes so you can have a preview of what's available in my config.

[source, shell]
----
nix flake show github:foo-dogsquared/nixos-config
----

It should export my NixOS configurations of my different hosts (of only one so far excluding VMs and VPSs ;p) among other things.
To install it, run the `nixos-install --flake github:foo-dogsquared/nixos-config#ni`.
(Please see the respective appropriate host README for more information.)




== Project structure

My NixOS config should look like the following:

[source, tree]
----
nixos-config
├── hosts/
├── lib/
├── modules/
├── pkgs/
├── secrets/
├── users/
├── flake.lock
├── flake.nix
└── README.adoc
----

* link:./hosts/[`./hosts/`] contain machine-specific configuration.
This usually configures like the hardware setup, timezone, and users.
Host configurations are also exported in the flakes in `outputs.nixosConfigurations`.

* link:./modules/[`./modules/`] contain my custom modules including NixOS and home-manager modules.
For more information, see the link:./modules/README.adoc[related documentation].

* link:./pkgs/[`./pkgs/`] contains my custom packages.
It is exported in the flakes at `outputs.packages` compiled through various systems.

* link:./secrets/[`./secrets/`] contains my secrets managed with link:https://github.com/ryantm/agenix[agenix].

* link:./users/[`./users/`] contains my link:https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager[home-manager] configurations and modules.
It is exported in the flakes at `outputs.homeConfigurations`.
For more information, see the link:./users/README.adoc[related documentation].




== TODO

In order of priority:

* [x] Create custom modules.
* [x] Create a themes system similar to link:https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles[this NixOS config].
* [ ] Create development shells.
* [x] Manage secrets with agenix.
* [x] Automate backups with NixOS config.
* [x] Create custom packages and export it to flakes. (Maybe consider making it to upstream)
* [x] Create cluser-wide configs.
* [x] Create host-wide configs.
* [x] Create user-specific configs with home-manager.
* [x] ~Steal~ Get some ideas from link:https://github.com/divnix/devos[this overengineered template].
* [x] Make use of other established utilities such as link:https://github.com/divnix/digga/[digga], link:https://github.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/flake-utils-plus[flake-utils-plus], and link:https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager[home-manager] once I'm familiar to create my own Nix programs.

Out of scope:

* Text editor configurations.
They are often updated. I don't want to rebuild it every time I change it.

* Migration of my link:https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/dotfiles[dotfiles].
I still use it on other non-NixOS systems.




== Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

[qanda]
Hello! I'm new to Nix and NixOS, where should I start?::
Oh no, you've seen the multiple configurations from other systems, didn't you?
I hope you're ready for some time understanding because the learning curve is steeper than the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_Wall[Troll Wall].
I've written link:https://foo-dogsquared.github.io/blog/posts/moving-into-nixos/[a blog post regarding my experience with Nix] with a bunch of links for getting started.
(Un)Fortunately, it is mostly the same experience now that I've revisited it.

Any requirements for this setup?::
You only need Nix 2.4 installed with the experimental features for Nix command and flakes enabled (i.e., `experimental-features = nix-command flakes`).




== Inspirations

I ~stole~ got the ideas from the following projects:

* link:https://github.com/divnix/devos[devos, an overengineered configuration framework.]
* link:https://github.com/divnix/digga/[digga, an flake utility library for your overengineered config.]
* link:https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles/[hlissner's dotfiles, the original inspiration for the structure and whatnot.]
