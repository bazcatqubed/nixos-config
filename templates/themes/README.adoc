= NixOS desktop themes

These are some of my themes om NixOS as a module ala-link:https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles[hlissner NixOS modules] as a https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter[Cookiecutter template].
Most of them just need a Pywal JSON scheme in the appropriate config file and generate the module with the given color scheme as a result.
