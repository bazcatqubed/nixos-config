= NixOS desktop themes

These are some of my themes om NixOS as a module ala-link:https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles[hlissner NixOS modules] as a https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter[Cookiecutter template].
Most of them just need a Pywal JSON scheme in the appropriate config file and generate the module with the given color scheme as a result.

Also, to make them working, you need to have home-manager installed (or do the hardwork of converting them to be suitable for system configuration yourself, your choice).
Furthermore, be careful when using the themes as they may override some of the current configuration.
The modules assume you don't have much installed and/or enabled (e.g., display servers, window managers) and handle installing those packages for you.
