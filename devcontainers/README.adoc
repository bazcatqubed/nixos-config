:toc:


Docker/OCI containers that are entirely built with Nix ecosystem.
For now, it is required to have `flakes` experimental feature enabled since some of the containers make use of them. footnote:[Ideally, it shouldn't but importing other Nix projects is pretty painful unless we go with either flakes and a dedicated pinning tool all the way.]

You can build this set of containers with the following command:

[source, shell]
----
# Either by referring to the files (which is easier IMO)...
nix build -f ./devcontainers [NAME] # or no name at all to build all of them.

# ...or by referring to the flake output.
nix build .#devContainers.$SYSTEM.$NAME
----

This set of containers should also be published at GitHub Container Registry at `ghcr.io/foo-dogsquared/nixos-config/$NAME`
