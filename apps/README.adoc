= Internal tools
:toc:


My custom project-specific applications that are more experimental in nature.
They're written for a variety of purposes but most of them are for experimenting with something Nix-specific and to make certain tasks easier for this project.
All of the programs in here are considered internal and is not intended for use on others' projects whatsoever.
Support for others' use cases are not going to be considered, anything that does are only a side effect.

Though it is considered internal, most of these tools are available as part of `apps` flake output.
They are intended for interacting with the project easier, not as a tool to be used for other projects.
