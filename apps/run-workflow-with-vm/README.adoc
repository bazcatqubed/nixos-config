= run-workflow-with-vm
:toc:

An internal script for the sole purpose of building NixOS VMs with the link:../../modules/nixos/_private/workflows[given NixOS workflows].
It is mainly used to developing them workflows (READ: rices).
As a (VERY NEAT) side effect, if we exported this app, we can basically let other people test and even reproduce our workflows with this script.
It only expects the name of the workflow as the first argument with the rest to be passed as part of `nix-build` (which is the backbone of the script).

When run, it should build a VM with its script to easily initialize it.


== Extra niceties

There's some niceties left with this script including the ability to include your own set of modules by overriding `extra-config` as part of the include path.
It is expected that the extra configuration folder is structured similarly to this NixOS cluster.

[source, tree]
----
./extra-config-stuff
├── home-manager
├── nixvim
└── nixos
----

Once you have an folder containing those extra snippets, you can simply include them like so.

[source, shell]
----
run-workflow-with-vm a-happy-gnome -I extra-config=./extra-config-stuff
