/*
  This is project data for deploying home-manager users with this flake. Each
  of the users defined here should correspond to one of the home-manager users
  at `./configs/home-manager/`.

  Schema:

  * systems
      A list of host platforms to be deployed. When given no systems, it will
      be deployed with `x86_64-linux`.
  * modules
      A list of home-manager modules to be included. Take note there is a
      baseline configuration defined at `flake.nix`. You should add modules
      very minimally here such as additional overlays, modules, and so forth.
  * home-manager-channel
      The home-manager branch to be used. By default, it uses the
      `home-manager` flake input which follows the `home-manager-unstable`
      input.
  * nixpkgs-channel
      The nixpkgs branch to be included. By default, it uses the `nixpkgs`
      flake input which follows the `nixos-unstable` input.
  * deploy
      An attribute set of options for deploy-rs nodes.
  * username
      The username of the home-manager user. By default, it will use the
      attribute name.
  * home-directory
      The home directory of the home-manager user. By default, it is
      set to "/home/${username}".
