Yes, tests!
We have tests for the major components of this NixOS configuration including the link:../lib[custom library], link:../modules/nixos[our custom NixOS modules], link:../modules/home-manager[custom home-manager modules], and so on.

Each of the test suite follows how the upstream does their tests.
For example, our home-manager module tests just copies what the upstream is doing.

You should be able to test them with the following command:

[source, shell]
----
# These commands assume you're in the project root.

# This test is for home-manager module tests.
nix-shell --pure ./tests/modules/home-manager -A list

# This is for the library.
nix eval -f ./tests lib
----
